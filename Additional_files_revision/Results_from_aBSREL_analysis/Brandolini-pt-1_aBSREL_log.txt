Analysis Description
--------------------
aBSREL (Adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood) uses an adaptive
random effects branch-site model framework to test whether each branch
has evolved under positive selection, using a procedure which infers an
optimal number of rate categories per branch. v2.2 adds support for
multiple-hit models. v2.3 adds support for SRV. v2.5 adds support for
ancestral state reconstruction, identification of sites contributing to
selection signal, and some diagnostics.

### Obtaining branch lengths and nucleotide substitution biases under the nucleotide GTR model

>kill-zero-lengths => Yes

### Deleted 2 zero-length internal branches: `Node10, Node6`
* Log(L) = -36942.20, AIC-c = 73926.41 (21 estimated parameters)
* 1 partition. Total tree length by partition (subs/site)  0.000

### Fitting the baseline model with a single dN/dS class per branch, and no site-to-site variation. 
* Log(L) = -35699.83, AIC-c = 71471.69 (36 estimated parameters)
* Branch-level non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio distribution has median  1.00, and 95% of the weight in  0.00 - 10000000000.00
